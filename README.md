# gpt_prompts
This repository is simply a place to add the different prompts that I use for my ChatGPT chats. These system prompts are instructions to improve the results of the answers from my ChatGPT chats.
All prompts are free for use and you have only to keep the terms and conditions of the LLM provider you decide to use. None of these prompts uses specific tokens from any LLM provider, they are just the 
system propmpt to create an agent that specializes in a specific task. 

As it is recommended, the prompts are separated by topics in order to get more relevant answers regarding the topics. The prompts are located [here](https://github.com/mihjovil/gpt_prompts/blob/main/prompts.md).
